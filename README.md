# catsim

The goal of catsim is to provide a similarity measure for binary or categorical images in either 2D or 3D
similar to the MS-SSIM index for color images. It is still a work in progress.

## Installation

You can install the released version of catsim from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
# install.packages("catsim")
devtools::install_github("gzt/catsim")
```

This is not actually on CRAN yet. Install using github.
