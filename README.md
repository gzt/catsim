# catsim

The goal of catsim is to provide a similarity measure for binary or
categorical images in either 2D or 3D similar to the MS-SSIM index for
color images.

## Installation

You can install the released version of catsim from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("catsim")
```

This is not actually on CRAN yet. Install using github.
