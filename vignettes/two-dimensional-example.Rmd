## Introduction to CatSIM

The **Cat**egorical **S**tructural Similarity **I**mage **M**etric, or **CatSIM**, 
provides a similarity metric for binary or multinary images or maps after the 
style of [MS-SSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity). That is,
CatSIM compares two different sets of labels of pixels (voxels) in 2-D (or 3-D) images
in an image. It attempts to assess similarity between two images in a way that accounts for the 
structural features of the image rather than a per-pixel discrepancy, ideally doing so
similarly to human assessments of similarity. The package implements the methods
described in [@thompson2020catsim].

## How CatSIM works

CatSIM computes a set of similarity metrics on a sliding window in the images, then
averages and combines them. In then downsamples the images and repeats the process.
Finally, it combines the measures from the different levels together. It can
use a variety of different similarity metrics inside of it depending on the specific
meaning of the labels in the image. By default, it uses
[Cohen's kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa) inside it as its
main comparison between the two images. However, there are several other options available
which are more appropriate in some contexts.

## Constructing a binary illustration

Besag [-@besag1986statistical] presents a $100 \times 88$ two-dimensional two-class image
with "intentionally awkward" features. Here we blow it up to three times its size 
and create two distorted versions to demonstrate how the method works.

The first distorted version is shifting the body of the figure over 6 pixels.
The second distorted version is adding salt-and-pepper noise so the error rate matches the 
difference between original and the shifted version.

```{r besag, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 2}
set.seed(20200308)

multfactor <- 3
onesmat <- matrix(1, multfactor, multfactor)
exmat <- (besag %% 2) ### converting to binary - it's ones and twos

bigmat <- exmat %x% onesmat

bigmat <- exmat %x% onesmat
shift <- 6
basemat <- bigmat[1:(96 * multfactor), 1:(84 * multfactor)]
shiftmat <- bigmat[(1 + shift):(96 * multfactor + shift), 1:(84 * multfactor)]
acc <- mean(basemat == shiftmat)
errmat <- (matrix(
  sample(0:1, 96 * 84 * (multfactor^2),
    replace = TRUE, prob = c(acc, ((1 - acc)))
  ),
  (96 * multfactor), (84 * multfactor)
) + basemat) %% 2
par(mfrow = c(1,3), mar = c(0,0,0,0))
image(basemat, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n"); grid(lwd = 3, nx = 6, col = "black")
image(shiftmat, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n"); grid(lwd = 3, nx = 6, col = "black")
image(errmat, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n"); grid(lwd = 3, nx = 6, col = "black")


```

Here we have the original, the shifted version, and the salt-and-pepper noise.
We argue that though the proportion of pixels that differ from the base image
are approximately the same for the two, an image similarity metric should
say the shift is better.

```{r besagrating}
catsim(basemat, shiftmat)

catsim(basemat, errmat)

```

As we might desire, the `catsim` metric judges the shift to be more like the original
than the salt-and-pepper noise.

Because this is a two-class image, you can consider using the Jaccard
index as the metric inside it with similar results:

```{r besagjacc}
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, method = "Jaccard")

catsim(basemat, errmat, method = "Jaccard")

```

## Constructing a multiclass example
To demonstrate how it works, first we construct a simple multicategory image and 
blow it up to a larger size. The grid lines are added for reference. This is our
"ground truth" image.

```{r construction, fig.width = 2, fig.height = 2}

multfactor <- 20
onesmat <- matrix(1, multfactor, multfactor)
exmat <- matrix(0, 12, 12)
exmat[2:10, c(2, 3, 9, 10)] <- 1
exmat[2:10, c(4, 5, 7, 8)] <- 2
exmat[5:7, 2:10] <- 1
exmat[2:10, c(6)] <- 3
par( mar = c(0,0,0,0))
image(exmat[11:1, 1:11], xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n")
  grid(col = "black", lwd = 3)
bigmat <- exmat %x% onesmat

```

Next, we construct two distorted versions. The first simply shifts the central
portion of the image over six pixels. Then, we compute the percentage of pixels that 
disagree with the baseline image and create a second distorted image by adding 
salt-and-pepper noise at that rate. Again, grid lines are added only for reference.

```{r distortion, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 4}
set.seed(20200323)
shift  <-  6 # we are shifting horizontally by six pixels
basemat <- bigmat[1:(11 * multfactor), 1:(11 * multfactor)]
shiftmat <- bigmat[(1 + shift) : (11 * multfactor + shift), 1: (11 * multfactor)]
### Here we have shifted the matrix slightly
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(0,0,0,0))
image(shiftmat, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n")
grid(col = "black", lwd = 3)

### computing the error rate
acc  <-  mean(basemat == shiftmat)
errmat <- (matrix(sample(0:3, 121 * (multfactor^2), replace = TRUE,
                         prob = c(acc, rep((1 - acc) / 3, 3))),
                        (11 * multfactor), (11 * multfactor)) + basemat) %% 4

### here we have made an image that matches its accuracy with salt and pepper noise
image(errmat, xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n")
grid(col = "black", lwd = 3)

```

Depending on your preferences, you may have reason to prefer one or the other,
but, arguably, the shifted version is in some sense better, even though their
pixelwise agreement is approximately the same.

## Computing Image Similarity
If we take only one level of `catsim`, we get the following results when
comparing to the initial matrix:

```{r onelevel}
library(catsim)
### comparing base to shifted
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, weights = 1)

### comparing base to salt-and-pepper
catsim(basemat, errmat, weights = 1)

### looking at accuracy
mean(basemat == shiftmat)
mean(basemat == errmat)

```

This captures the similarity between the original image and the shifted image, but
is too "critical" of the salt-and-pepper error. We can correct this by looking 
at the image on multiple scales: we downsample by a factor of 2 and then compute
the index for that layer, then repeat, and combine the layers at the end into
one measure. By default, we use 5 layers of downsampling, but this can be specified
based on your application and the size of the image. Downsampling should remove 
and smooth out a light level of salt-and-pepper error.

With five levels, the difference is smaller, but still prefers the shifted version
over the salt and pepper error.

```{r fivelevels}
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, weights = rep(.2, 5))

### comparing base to salt-and-pepper
catsim(basemat, errmat, weights = rep(.2, 5))

```

## CatSIM options
By default, CatSIM uses [Cohen's kappa ($\kappa$)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen's_kappa)
as the similarity comparison for the images. This measures agreement between the classes with
and adjustment for the probability of chance agreement. However, depending on the application,
a different comparison might make sense. The following options are available (using 
the `method` argument):

* [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), suitable for binary images where presence of 
one class is important (for instance, fMRI activation maps), with `method="Jaccard"`.
* [Dice index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient), 
 which is similar to the Jaccard index, with `method="Dice"`.
* [Rand index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index), a similarity metric for comparing clusterings based
on whether pairs of points are in the same group, with `method="Rand"`.
* [Adjusted Rand index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_index#Adjusted_Rand_index), 
a modification of the Rand index which corrects for the probability of chance agreements, with 
`method ="AdjRand"` or `ARI`.
* Accuracy, or pixel-wise agreement, which is simply `(# pixels agreeing)/(# pixels)`, with `method="accuracy"`. 
* [Normalized mutual information](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-clustering-1.html), 
a information theory similarity metric based on the Kullback-Liebler divergence between the 
 two distributions, with `method = "NMI"` or `MI`. 
 * [Adjusted mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjusted_mutual_information), a correction to
 the mutual information to account for the probability of chance agreements, with `method = "AMI"`.


```{r differentmetrics}
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, weights = rep(.5,2), method="Rand")
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, weights = rep(.5,2), method="NMI")

```
The window size can also be adjusted. It should be large enough to capture
the scale of the features that are relevant in the analysis. In this example,
a portion of the image was displaced by 6 pixels. Too large of a window may 
average out that difference too much while too small may miss the similarity 
between the images. Here is a comparison between the shifted image and the 
salt-and-pepper noise at different window sizes.

```{r windowsize}
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, weights = rep(1 / 3, 3), window = 20)
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, weights = rep(1 / 3, 3), window = 5)
catsim(basemat, errmat, weights = rep(1 / 3, 3), window = 20)
catsim(basemat, errmat, weights = rep(1 / 3, 3), window = 5)

```

The number of levels CatSIM uses can be set by specifying either the `levels`
argument or passing a vector to `weights`, where the length of the vector
dictates how many levels of downsampling will be performed. By default,
if the number of levels are specified without specifying the weights, 
the weights are set to be equal across levels and add up to 1.
Specifying `weights = rep(1/3,3)` is the same as specifying `levels = 3`.

## Advanced Functionality
The `catsim()` function works for both 2-D and 3-D images. It is a wrapper
for other functions which give more control over the various options.
On a 2-D image, it is calling `catmssim_2d()` and on a 3-D image it is 
calling either `catmssim_3d_cube()` or `catmssim_3d_slice()`, which 
treats the image as either an isotropic 3-D image or a stack of 2-D slices.

In images with different properties across dimensions, the sliding window
used to assess the similarity might not need to be square.
This can be specified by passing a vector to the `window` argument. In the
provided examples, this is not necessary, but some sources of 
images may not be isotropic. Alternatively, the image may be 
elongated in one direction and narrow in another. This makes
it possible to accommodate these differences.

```{r windowarg}
catsim(basemat, shiftmat, weights = rep(.2, 5), window = c(11, 5))
```
