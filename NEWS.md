# catsim 0.2.3
* Minor update to fix the last URLs. Arxiv links in bibliographic 
expansion expand to http rather than https, so this has to be 
fixed by specifying the URL in the .bib file.

# catsim 0.2.2
* Fix update to C++ tests in testthat test suite. This was causing an LTO error.
* Update some URLs to use https instead of http.

# catsim 0.2.1
* Fix some cosmetic issues in README.Rmd
* Fix a spurious warning in compiled code about an unused variable. 

# catsim 0.2.0
* Last cosmetic cleanups and bumping version number because
this really should have been done for the change in 0.1.5,
as removing deprecated functions needs a bigger version bump.

# catsim 0.1.6
* Clean up final documentation issues in preparation for submission to CRAN.

# catsim 0.1.5
* Remove deprecated `AdjRandIndex` files.

# catsim 0.1.4
* Further refinement of `pickmode(random)` handling
* Further documentation and vignette updates.
* Move to Markdown documentation.

# catsim 0.1.2
* Improve handling of `...` arguments.
* Easier access to `pickmode(random)` argument.
* Included `hoffmanphantom` dataset.

# catsim 0.1.1
* Change deterministic PRNG for downsampling to not assign to parent
  environment to preserve state, made the option to use `sample`
  accessible to advanced users through `...` arguments.
* Fixed some documentation. 

# catsim 0.1.0
* Mostly documentation fixes.
* Version used for paper submission.

# catsim 0.1.0.9040

* Add `besag` image as a data example.
* Changed names of similarity functions to use "_" instead of "camel case".
* Features still being added.

# catsim 0.1.0.9039

* Added `levels` argument to `catsim()`. Weights or levels can be specified. 
  `levels` alone will define `weights = rep(1, levels)/levels`. If `weights` 
  and `levels` are both specified, `weights = weights[1:levels]`. 
* Added documentation.

# catsim 0.1.0.9038

* Added normalized mutual information and adjusted mutual information
  as similarity metrics and into AdjRandIndex function, which really 
  should be renamed.
* Split out the various similarity measures and exported them. Deprecated
  `AdjRandIndex()` function.

# catsim 0.1.0.9037

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added more tests, documentation.
* The package is mostly complete in its features.
